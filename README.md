<h2 id="start"> Getting Started  üéâ </h2>

The `protocol-solidity-extensions` contains `protocol-solidity` protocol extensions. These are protocols that build on top of the core `protocol-solidity` contracts by adding new functionality and enabling new applications. The current applications supported and in development here are:
- Identity Protocol - An identity-based shielded pool implementation using Semaphore as the identity provider.
- MASP Protocol - A multi-asset shielded pool protocol supporting incentives, swaps, and delegatable proof generation.

For additional information on the base `protocol-solidity`, please refer to the [Webb protocol-solidity implementation docs](https://webb-tools.github.io/protocol-solidity/) and the official [Webb docs site](http://docs.webb.tools/) üìù. Have feedback on how to improve protocol-solidity? Or have a specific question to ask? Checkout the [Anchor System Feedback Discussion](https://github.com/webb-tools/feedback/discussions/categories/anchor-protocol) üí¨.

## Prerequisites

Your development environment will need to include nodejs, and Rust setups. If you need to generate fixtures you will also require Circom 2.0 and snarkjs installations. You can find installation instructions below. 

This repository makes use of node.js, yarn, Rust, and requires version 16. To install node.js binaries, installers, and source tarballs, please visit https://nodejs.org/en/download/. Once node.js is installed you may proceed to install [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install):

```
npm install --global yarn
```

Great! Now your **Node** environment is ready! üöÄüöÄ

You must also have Rust installed. This guide uses <https://rustup.rs> installer and the `rustup` tool to manage the Rust toolchain.

First install and configure `rustup`:

```bash
# Install
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
# Configure
source ~/.cargo/env
```

Configure the Rust toolchain to default to the latest nightly version, and add the nightly wasm target:

```bash
rustup default nightly
rustup update
rustup update nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Great! Now your **Rust** environment is ready! üöÄüöÄ

Lastly, install 

  - [DVC](https://dvc.org/) is used for fetching large ZK files and managing them alongside git
  - [substrate.io](https://docs.substrate.io/main-docs/install/) may require additional dependencies

üöÄüöÄ Your environment is complete! üöÄüöÄ

### Generating Fixtures Prerequisites

> NOTE: This is only required for testing / dev purposes and not required to compile or interact with smart contracts. 

To generate fixtures you will need Circom 2.0 and snarkjs installed. To install from source, clone the circom repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/iden3/circom.git
```

Enter the circom directory and use the cargo build to compile:
```
cargo build --release
```

The installation takes around 3 minutes to be completed. When the command successfully finishes, it generates the circom binary in the directory `target/release`. You can install this binary as follows:
```
cargo install --path circom
```
The previous command will install the circom binary in the directory `$HOME/.cargo/bin`.

#### Installing snarkjs

snarkjs is a npm package that contains code to generate and validate ZK proofs from the artifacts produced by circom.

You can install snarkjs with the following command:
```
npm install -g snarkjs
```

<h2 id="compile"> Installation & Compile üíª </h2>

Install dependencies: 

```
yarn install 
```

Update submodules:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Populate fixtures from the submodules:

```
yarn fetch:fixtures
```

To compile contracts and build typescript interfaces

```
yarn build
```

To run test suite:

```
yarn test
```

To fix the formatting, please run:

```
yarn format
```

**Note:** If you push new fixtures to remote storage

```
cd solidity-fixtures
dvc add solidity-fixtures
dvc push --remote aws
```
