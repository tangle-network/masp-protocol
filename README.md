<h2 id="start"> Getting Started </h2>

The `masp-protocol` contains a `protocol-solidity` protocol extension for multi-asset shielded pools. Multi-asset shielded pools (MASP) are pools that shield multiple asset types under one pool system. This protocol currently supports both ERC20 fungible assets as well as non-fungible (NFT) assets. This protocol is built on top of the core `protocol-solidity` contracts by adding new functionality.

Other features of this MASP protocol are
- Shielded atomic swaps (SAS) between ERC20 and NFT assets.
- Delegatable proof generation for outsourcing heavy computation.
- Liquidity incentives for anonymity set growth.
- Viewing keys for compliance.
- Rollup functionality for batched deposits.
- (Coming soon) Fuzzy message detection over encrypted records.

For additional documentation on the MASP protocol, please refer to the [Webb MASP docs](https://docs.webb.tools/docs/protocols/masp/overview/).

For additional information on the base `protocol-solidity`, please refer to the [Webb protocol-solidity implementation docs](https://webb-tools.github.io/protocol-solidity/) and the official [Webb docs site](http://docs.webb.tools/).

<h2 id="compile"> Installation & Compile ðŸ’» </h2>

Install dependencies: 

```
yarn install 
```

Update submodules:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Populate fixtures from the submodules:

```
yarn fetch:fixtures
```

To compile contracts and build typescript interfaces

```
yarn build
```

To run test suite:

```
yarn test
```

To fix the formatting, please run:

The installation takes around 3 minutes to be completed. When the command successfully finishes, it generates the circom binary in the directory `target/release`. You can install this binary as follows:
```
yarn format
```
The previous command will install the circom binary in the directory `$HOME/.cargo/bin`.

**Note:** If you push new fixtures to remote storage

snarkjs is a npm package that contains code to generate and validate ZK proofs from the artifacts produced by circom.

You can install snarkjs with the following command:
```
cd solidity-fixtures
dvc add solidity-fixtures
dvc push --remote aws
```

## Troubleshooting

[1] You may get following error while building on macBook if `gnu-sed` is not installed. Install it and add to your path as discussed [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43696304/how-do-i-fix-sed-illegal-option-r-in-macos-sierra-android-build).
```bash
sed: 1: "packages/masp-anchor-co ...": extra characters at the end of p command
sed: 1: "packages/masp-anchor-co ...": extra characters at the end of p command
error Command failed with exit code 1.
